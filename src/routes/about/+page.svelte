            Hi. I'm Youwen. My foremost passion is writing - code, math, and words. I strive for
            elegant code, beautiful math, and authentic prose.

            I learned how to code when I was in 3rd grade (around 8-9 years old). Regrettably, I am
            not a gifted genius and did not build a massive open source empire nor did I found a
            startup before the age of 12. My projects consisted principally of crummy games or
            terrible websites. My biggest regret is spending the pandemic lockdown learning React
            and web development in 2020 instead of becoming a cool kernel hacker or something.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Nowadays, my personal projects primarily consist of tools to make life easier. My
            academic interest is in exploring how we can improve the reliability of computer
            programs through formal mathematical methods - namely, the correspondence between
            programs, proofs, and categories.

            Most people I know in real life think that I am some kind of hacker - likely because
            they once saw me open up a text terminal and update my packages with <code>pacman</code
            >. I proclaim myself a hacker because I once learned how to create shoddy CRUD web
            applications with fad web technologies and believe that places me in the same group as
            Torvalds and the other hackers who build actual software.

            I learn about math I find interesting as a hobby. I also happen to be pursuing it an
            undergraduate degree in it, soon.

            I tried doing math competitions in middle and early high school before I realized that
            it wasn't for me (that's my way of saying that I couldn't hope to compete with the
            prodigies). Still, I wholly recommend that anyone who likes math take a look at <a

              class="link">The Art of Problem Solving</a

            more valuable than a shallow familiarity with formulas or integration methods.
